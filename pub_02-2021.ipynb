    "   > ”insecure by design“ command line argument called `--extra-index-url`. When using this argument with `pip install library` to specify your own package index, you may find that it works as expected, but what pip is actually doing behind the scenes goes something like this:\n",

    "   > * Checks whether `library` exists on the specified (internal) package index\n",
    "   > * Checks whether `library` exists on the public package index (PyPI)\n",
    "   > * Installs whichever version is found. If the package exists on both, it defaults to installing from the source with the **higher version number**.\n",

    "\n",
    "   > In Python, the `install` name of a package can be different from the `import` name. This allows for an unique type of typosquatting attack by uploading under unclaimed import names on PyPI, where it can be downloaded by developers, or even automated tools.\n",
